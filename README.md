# Emotion Recognition Model using Teachable Machine

This machine learning model is trained to recognize human emotions from 48x48 greyscale images. The model is built using Teachable Machine and is trained on a dataset of hundreds of examples from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train this model consists of 48x48 greyscale images of people's faces, each labeled with one of four emotions:

* Anger
* Happiness
* Neutral
* Surprise

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is used to train the model to recognize patterns and features that are indicative of each emotion.

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and prediction metrics, which can be found in the `results` folder. The model has achieved a high accuracy rate, demonstrating its ability to effectively recognize human emotions from the input images.
